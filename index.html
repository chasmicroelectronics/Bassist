                <p>Chris plays a Wood n Tronic Aileron 6 string headless, Shuker Jazz 5 string fretless, a Warwick Thumb
                    6 string and a Peavey C5 passive (5 string) though a TC electronic Spectra comp, MXR DI+ into a Genz

                <h2>Background<small> - an origin story</small></h2>
                <p>From humble beginnings as a classical guitarist, Chris got to university and realised electric
                    guitarists were plentiful but bass players were nowhere to be found. Grabbing a terrible bass guitar
                    from a second hand shop, he set about moving his classical guitar techniques to bass and co-founded
                    a pop-punk sensation, legends in their own lunchbox, Disinformation, in Loughborough at the turn of
                    the millennium. He soon grew out of the £40 knock-off Squire P-bass and entered the alluring world
                    of GAS, building a stable of 4, 5 and ultimately 6 string basses.</p>
                <p>Chris’ journey post-graduation took him up the M1 to the steel city, Sheffield. Here he played in a
                    couple of cover bands, an interesting if not overly successful Folk Metal outfit, and finally
                    landed, in 2009, in local Prog-rockers Firegarden. That 6th string soon came in handy and he’s been
                    holding down the low end ever since. </p>
                <p>More recently Chris joined function band Patriots UK to bring rock and pop to the WMC’s of Yorkshire
                    and the North-East, and with it more BV duties and a regular workout rigging the PA to his stable of
                    talents.</p>
